```
Lowering legal barriers to make it easier for minors to undergo cross-sex medical
interventions without parental consent does not reduce suicide rates—
```
needs proof
```
in fact, it likely leads to higher rates of suicide among young people in states
that adopt these changes.
```
needs proof
```
States should instead adopt parental bills of rights that affirm the fact that
parents have primary responsibility for their children’s education and health,
```
on face value, this sounds like a good idea, but there are possible issues that
will propegate up if given the change, such as an increase in sex-abuse, and an
increase in homophobia/transphobia. This also may increase the neglect that kids
face if more responsability is put upon parents to educate their children. All
of this is heresay though, because no actual 'bill of rights' is proposed. This
is just an idea at this point. An actual draft would need to be provided in order
for it to be considered. I'm not inheritly against a bill of rights for parents,
but the language used does give me pause.
```
and that require school officials and health professionals to receive permission
from parents before administering health services,
```
I see this argument a lot. Several issues appear when something like this is
implemented though, including a refusal from parents for life saving medical
services. Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions. However, despite religous
beliefes i belive it is imperitive to save the lives of those kids. This idea is
shown througout HIPA.
```
including medication and “gender-affirming” counseling, to children under 18.
```
What is the definition of 'medication' here? Too broad. "gender-affirming"
counseling has been something proposed by the Right as something that should be
required by law before recieving gender-affirming medical care. I really hope
that at the very least, this article stays philosophically consistent with being
anti-gender-affirming counseling. In any case though, I may be wrong about this,
but I don't believe that parents currently have the right to know what is talked
about between child and counselor unless the child gives permission. I know that
this article is for chainging that, however this separation between child and
parents is for a reason. I believe that parents should NOT be privy to private
conversations between child and counselor because there are things that said
children should have a right to privacy about. If a child's secrets are forced
to be shared with parents, a window of abusive opens up within the home, creating
a deeply unsafe situation between parents and children.

```
States should also tighten the criteria for receiving cross-sex treatments,
including raising the minimum eligibility age.
```
so are we pro-states rights, or are we not? again, it seems that the Right will
take positions that favor the Right's beliefs when it comes to states' rights,
but will call daddy Fed when a state is violating what the Right believes in.
I really hope this author stays consitent in what he believes in...

also, if the point of this article is to save children's lives, then there must
be imperical proof that children who experience trans feelings and go through with
gender-affiriming medical treatments experience suicidal-ideation due to the treatments
themselves, and not the abusive expereinced by family members.

```
KEY TAKEAWAYS
1. U.S. policymakers are seeking to make it easier for minors to access puberty
blockers and cross-sex hormones based on the claim that doing so reduces
suicide risk.
2. Studies finding that “gender-affirming” interventions prevent suicide fail
to show a causal relationship and have been poorly executed.
```
The lack of evidence for a claim is not evidence against said claim. I am however
excited to see their arguments against the current data we have on this subject.
```
3. A superior research design shows that easing access to puberty blockers and
cross-sex hormones by minors without parental consent increases suicide rates.
```
1. they will need to prove that the new research design is more credible
('superior') than the previous one.
2. they will need to prove that NOT access to puberty blockers and cross-sex
hormones by minors without parental consent increases suicide rates, but
increasing access causes suicide rates. I'm sure you can see the problem with
the phrasing of this claim

```
Adolescents who are confused about their gender suffer from an abnormally high
suicide rate (Michelle M. Johns et al., “Transgender Identity and Experiences
of Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sexual Risk
Behaviors Among High School Students—19 States and Large Urban School Districts,
2017,” Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Vol. 68, No. 3 (January 25, 2019),
pp. 67–71, https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6803a3 (accessed May 25, 2022).)
```
Okay, so right here, this guy obviously did not read this study. It's from the
CDC. Right from the get-go, confounding variables such as 'affects of violence
victimization', 'substance' use and 'STDs' need to be accounted for. All of these
variables are hardcore contributers to suicide among anyone who expereinces them.
The study itself does not say that trans kids expereince suicide-ideation ONLY
due to being gender-non-conforming, but because of anterior factors as well.
So using this study in this way, is HUGELY dishonest. Becuase the author is trying
to convey not what the study is trying to convey, but instead what the author
is trying to convey, that 'because trans kids expereince suicide, we should
prevent trans kids from exisiting'.

```
Though research demonstrates that gender confusion generally resolves itself
without medical intervention,2 James M. Cantor, “Transgender and Gender Diverse
Children and Adolescents: Fact-Checking of AAP Policy,” Journal of Sex & Marital
Therapy, Vol. 46, No. 4, 2020), pp. 307–313,

Transgender Moment (New York, NY: Encounter Books, 2018), pp. 93–144.
```
1. the author did not define 'gender confusion', which is highly important in the
context of these studies. BECAUSE gender confusion in this study is defined to
encompas a series of attributes displayed by young kids, including boys playing
with dolls, and girls climbing trees. This is OBVIOUSLY NOT a sign of someone being
trans. Not saying that this article is defining 'gender confusion' like this,
because the article sited sits behind a pay wall, but I am defining 'gender
confusion' like this because that is how I have seen it defined in the past.
2. the author is mis-using another article, NOT a study. You can see it here:
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0092623X.2019.1698481?scroll=top&needAccess=true
Except you CANT! because it's behind a pay-wall. Very tricky in deed. If I can't
read the article, how am I supposed to verify it?
3. The author is treating this like a study, when it is just an article, another
mark of dishonesty.

```
some educators and medical professionals encourage teens, and even pre-teens,
to take puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones so that their secondary sex
characteristics, such as body and facial hair, breast tissue, muscular build,
and fat composition, align more closely with the gender with which they identify.
(3 Society for Evidence Based Gender Medicine, “Our Aim Is to Promote Safe,
Compassionate, Ethical and Evidence-Informed Healthcare for Children,
Adolescents, and Young Adults with Gender Dysphoria,”

```
1. the author makes a huge claim here that 'some' educators and medical professionals
ENCOURAGE teens to take medical procedures that alter their physical characteristsics.
this has to be proven or it's heresay
2. I could not find the referenced study, but I did look at the referenced website.
here on their studies section: https://segm.org/studies, you can see many
cautionary studies that push individuals considering treatment to have 'informed
consent' and to know exactly what the dangers are. The use of the word 'ENCOURAGE'
feels very misleading because there is an inherit spin taken upon this community.
As if this org is trying to 'get' the youth. Very emotionaly charged diction.

```
While the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)
acknowledges that these interventions can have significant complications, it
warns that delaying intervention also has serious risks:

Refusing timely medical interventions for adolescents might prolong gender
dysphoria and contribute to an appearance that could provoke abuse and
stigmatization. As the level of gender-related abuse is strongly associated
with the degree of psychiatric distress during adolescence (Nuttbrock et al., 2010),
withholding puberty suppression and subsequent feminizing or masculinizing
hormone therapy is not a neutral option for adolescents. (Eli Coleman et al.,
“Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender
Nonconforming People,” International Journal of Transgenderism, Vol. 13, No. 4
(2012), p. 21, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15532739.2011.700873
(accessed May 25, 2022).)
```
yes.

```
Other advocates, members of the media, and even White House staff invoke
scientific authority to assert that cross-sex medical interventions reduce the
risk of suicide. Sarah Harte, director for the Washington, DC, branch of an
organization that provides medical intervention and support for youth called
The Dorm, stated with confidence that “[l]aws and systems barring gender-affirming
healthcare will contribute to higher rates of significant mental health problems,
including deaths by suicide.”(5 “The ‘Life-Saving’ Science Behind Gender-Affirming
Care for Youth,” Medical News Today, March 29, 2022,
https://www.medicalnewstoday.com​/articles/the-life-saving-science-behind-gender-affirming-care-for-youth (accessed May 25, 2022).)

The CEO of The Trevor Project, Amit Paley, said, “It’s clear that
gender-affirming care has the potential to reduce rates of depression and
suicide attempts.”(6 Jo Yurcaba, “Hormone Therapy Linked to Lower Suicide Risk
for Trans Youths, Study Finds,” NBC News, December 14, 2021,
https://www.nbcnews.com​/nbc-out/out-health-and-wellness/hormone-therapy-linked-lower-suicide-risk-trans-youths-study-finds-rcna8617
(accessed May 25, 2022).)

In an opinion piece in The Washington Post, University of Virginia Law School
professors Anne Coughlin and Naomi Cahn claimed that cross-sex medication
“has been shown to reduce the risk of depression and suicide for transgender
youth,” and that “banning it creates an excruciating conflict for parents, as
the steps they take to preserve their children’s lives may lead the state to
investigate and punish them.”(7“Texas Is Trampling Parents’ Rights in Its Investigations of Trans Kids,” The Washington Post, April 8, 2022, https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook​/2022/04/08/texas-transgender-family-law/ (accessed May 25, 2022).)

Even former White House press secretary Jen Psaki referred to such medical
interventions as “medically necessary, lifesaving healthcare for [kids].”8
```

1. the phrase 'invoke scientific authority' invokes a feeling of distrust in
science in general and an attack on scientific authority. This iteself is a
dishonest attack on their positoins. instead of attacking their positions from
a place of logos, the author is using pathos to make a feelings argument, trying
to scare the reader into feeling like the 'scientific authority' is one to be
distrusted just because so far the scientific studies cited in these situations
do not support the author's positions. Another dishonest spin on the subject at
hand.
2. okay so right here we are identifying articles and studies that are in favor
of the opposite argument, that gender-affirming medical intervention DECREASES
harm in trans youth. I expect the author to directly confront the studies/articles
data collection methods in an effort to prove that other studies antagonistic
to the trans movment are more trust worthy than these.
3. I totally understand that Jen Psaki disagrees with the author, however, what
does Jen have anything to do with the medical research? I feel like this is 
narative building which is trying to evoke a feeling of distrust from anyone
and everyone in a position of authority in an effort to attack the Left, instead
of the Left's positions.

```
The danger of adolescents committing suicide if they do not receive these
medical interventions is thought to be so urgent that the Biden Administration
recently issued a statement “confirming the positive impact of gender affirming
care on youth mental health,” while referencing “the evidence behind the positive
effects of gender affirming care.”(9 The White House, “Fact Sheet:
Biden–Harris Administration Advances Equality and Visibility for Transgender
Americans,” March 31, 2022,
https://​www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-advances-equality-and-visibility-for​-transgender-americans/ (accessed May 25, 2022).)
```
the use of the phrase by the author 'so urgent' and the context surrounding
it evokes a feeling of apathy from the reader. This is a silly rehtorial device
used to bias the reader before what is about to be said, is said. This is
poissoning the well.

```
A number of states have also considered or enacted legislation making it easier
for minors to access cross-sex interventions without their parents’ knowledge
or consent. For example, California recently enacted a new law, AB 1184, to
prevent insurance companies from notifying parents if children on their policies
receive “sensitive services,” which were defined to include “gender affirming care.”
(10 California Legislative Information, Assembly Bill No. 1184 “Medical Information: Confidentiality,” https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml​?bill_id=202120220AB1184 (accessed May 25, 2022); Brandon Richards, “Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California Statement on Passage of AB 1184,” Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, September 9, 2021, https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-affiliates-california​/media/planned-parenthood-affiliates-california-statement-passage-ab-11 (accessed May 25, 2022); and Nancy Flory, “California Gov. Newsom Signs Bill into Law that Allows Children to Hide Abortions, Transgender Treatments, from Parents,” The Stream, September 28, 2021, https://stream.org/california​-gov-newsom-signs-bill-into-law-that-allows-children-to-hide-abortions-transgender-treatments-from-parents/ (accessed May 25, 2022).)
```
The context sourounding this statement evokes a feeling that the author is trying
to say that the inverse should be what actually happens. That parents are notified
on every item that their kids recieve while on their insurance. Well, what about
kids who are still on their parents insurace until they turn 26??? Is a 26, or a
25 year old bound to share all priavte information with their parents? This point
from the author is an attempt to make the reader believe that even the younger
children (sub 15 even), are traveling all the way down to the doctor's office,
and asking to get their nuts chopped off. In what world is this happening? This
is another dishonest use of rhetoric.

```
However, young people may also experience significant and irreversible harms
from such medical interventions.

```
1. two statements need to be corroberated by this study: 1. there is 'significant
harm', and 2. there is 'irreversible harm' from gender-affirming procedures
mentioned here, and ONLY the referenced procederues mentioned here. However, the
way that the author says, 'such medical interventions' leads the audience to
believe that the author is saying ALL gender-affirming procedures have irreversible
and significant harms. Another lazy and dishonest rhetorical strategy.
2. after reading this study, one line jumped out at me: "patients ‘understand
the risks of GnRH analogue treatment for bone density (i.e., risks of later
osteoporosis)’" if one understands the risks involved in a situation, why should
the government prevent a decision that would only affect the individual? This
seems sily. It's also AGAIN an anti-Right position to take. The author is implying
that the government should have presendece over what individuals medically do with
themselves. This is authoritarian. I hope that this author staying consistent
in his beliefs.
3. ALSO, after reading this 'study' (which is actually just another article),
it's clear that the claims of irreversible and significant harm is NOT corroberated.
in fact, nothing of the sort is even mentioned. The author of referenced article
himself states that, "Joseph et al.’s recommendations are... to reduce DXA
monitoring which ‘can have significant financial implications for healthcare providers’.
Another is to change the computation of Z-scores; ‘reference ranges may need to
be re-defined for this select patient cohort’. Rather than altering a measure
that provides inconvenient findings, practitioners of puberty suppression must
record fractures as adverse events. One British patient who started GnRHa at age
12 then experienced four broken bones by the age of 16 [10]. This history, if
it were combined with BMD Z-scores below −2, would meet the diagnostic criteria
for paediatric osteoporosis [11]. Whether this case is exceptional is unknown
because clinicians have failed to collect relevant data." Meaning, that the
referenced article is FAR from a complete repudiation of gender-affirming
procedures, this so far is probalbly the most BLATENT lie in the article.


```
This Backgrounder reviews existing research on the relationship between
cross-sex interventions and suicide, and then presents a new empirical
analysis that examines whether easing access by adolescents to these
interventions is likely to result in fewer adolescent suicides.
```
1. empirical is defined as such: "Verifiable or provable by means of
observation or experiment." Because the claim of this article is as such, if
the author does not demonstrate this, then this is a dishonest article and
irresponsibly written and published. And by the way, in order to have an
"empirical analysis" of this topic, research has to be done via a double blind
study on a population large enough to make a statistical difference. This
supposed study also would require participants to assume a level of risk of
suicide, which would immediately disqualify the study due to ethical risks.
So, I'm assuming that said study does not actually exists, but I guess we will
find out...
```
The new analysis presented here finds that the existing literature on this
topic suffers from a series of weaknesses that prevent researchers from being
able to draw credible causal conclusions about a relationship between medical
interventions and suicide.
```
1. great. so if this is the case, then there should be no need to use language
tainted with bias in this article, if all that is being said, is "we need more
research". However, I get the sense that this article is not being used to say
only that, but to instead push against trans rights.

```
Using a superior research design, the new analysis finds that increasing
minors’ access to cross-sex interventions is associated with a significant
increase in the adolescent suicide rate.
```
claims made: 1. the new research design has outputed an analysis that shows a
direct relationship to minors' access to 'cross-sex interventions', and an increase
in adolescent suicide rate.

```
Rather than facilitating access by
minors to these medical interventions without parental consent, states should
be pursuing policies that strengthen parental involvement in these important
decisions with life-long implications for their children.
```
this proposal is going to require evidence as well that increasing parental
involement decreases suicide rates in order for this prescriptive statement to
act as a solution to the previous descriptive statement.

```
The Context
Around 1990, some doctors in the Netherlands began to use drugs designed to
delay the onset of puberty in teenagers who were confused about their gender.
(12 Ibid.)
```
1. again, the author is using biased, emotionally charged language when the term
'confused' is used. If this article is supposed to be taken seriously, then
academic langauge should be used. By setting the context as such before showing
off the supposed evidence is poisoning the well (which is a logical fallacy)

```
Puberty-blocking therapies, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues,
were meant to prevent children entering puberty from developing the secondary
sex characteristics, such as facial hair for men or breasts for women, if those
features did not align with the gender with which they identified. Puberty
blockers would be followed by the use of sex hormones, such as testosterone,
for girls who identify as male, and estrogen for boys who identify as female,
so that they could develop secondary sex characteristics that were associated
with the sex that they identified with.
(13 Klotz, “The Fractious Evolution of Pediatric Transgender Medicine.”)
```



```
This treatment protocol of puberty blockers followed by cross-sex hormones among
adolescents did not exist in the United States prior to 2007 and was extremely
rare before 2010. Cross-sex hormones were available as a medical intervention
for adolescents before 2010, but their use was extremely limited. Starting in
2010, however, the use of both puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for
adolescents who identified as transgender rose dramatically and was widely
available by 2015.

Precise data are not available on how often puberty blockers and cross-sex
hormones have been given to teenagers over time in the United States, but it is
possible to track a proxy for these interventions. Google Trends provides data
on the relative frequency that terms have been used for searches since 2004.
A score of 100 in Google Trends indicates the peak frequency for the term.
Before August 2007, Google Trends reports a 0 for the term “puberty blockers,”
meaning that it was searched so infrequently in the U.S. that “there was not
enough data for this term.” The term “puberty blockers” did not average 5, or
one-twentieth of its peak popularity, in any year before 2015.14
Google Trends, “Puberty Blockers,” https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2004-01-01%202020-12-31&geo=US&q=puberty%20blockers (accessed April 20, 2022).
Note: Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the
chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for
a term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means
there was not enough data for this term.

The average of the Google Trends scores for the terms, “puberty blockers,”
“transgender,” “gender identity disorder,” and “gender dysphoria,” yields a
reasonable proxy for how common cross-sex interventions have been over time.
(15 Ibid.; Google Trends, “Transgender,” Google Trends, https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2004-01-01%202020-12-31&geo=US&q=puberty​%20blockers (accessed April 20, 2022); Google Trends, “Gender Identity Disorder,” https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2004-01-01%202020-12-31&geo=US&q=puberty%20blockers (accessed May 20, 2022); and Google Trends, “Gender Dysphoria,” https://trends.google.com/trends​/explore?date=2004-01-01%202020-12-31&geo=US&q=puberty%20blockers (accessed April 20, 2022).)

As shown in Chart 1, these four terms were searched infrequently until about 2015,
when there was a dramatic increase that continued through the end of 2020. This
picture is consistent with anecdotal reports of how the use of puberty blockers
and cross-sex hormones only became widely available in the past several years.
```
1. okay so this is just FLAT OUT SILLY. The surrounding context of the paragraph
enokes a feeling in the audience that being trans is simply a trend that is gaining
popularity. This is again a serious violation of the 'poisoning the well' logical
fallacy. The infered position that the author is taking is that being trans is
NOT a core part of humanity that has been documented for thousands of years, but
instead, a new trend that is dangerous to children that must be stopped. This is
an argument. Not a study. Not a proven fact. The use of Google trends in this
context is used to give more ethos to the argument at hand. By the rules of
google trends, even if just 1 person searched for hormone blockers pre-2015, and
just 5 people searched for it post-2015, a similar graph would be shown. This
is simply a deeply dishonest attempt at convincing the audience of the subliminal
argument being made. Deeply deeply dishonest argement here.

2. The contextual argument being made is that children are searching up these
terms in order to seek out gender-affirming procedures. However, that's NOT even
what Google Trends is saying. All Google Trends is saying is that people are
searching for these terms. How many of these people are googling these terms after
watching Tucker Carlson or Steven Crowder give an anti-trans segment? We DO NOT
KNOW! This is furthering the dishonesty of this article.

3. If I were to go to any college professor of stats or scientific research, and
ask them what their thoughts are on using Google Trends to track application
intrest of gender-affirming procedures, the professor asked would laugh me out of
town. This is hardly a data collection tool. so far, the claim that 'emperical'
data collection being used is absolutely laughable. Even I, who got a C- in
high school stats, knows that this method of data collection is nothing more that
vitally flawed.

```
There is also a lack of precise information on where cross-sex medical
interventions are more readily available to adolescents.
```
1. huh? is this an argument against trans education for addolesence or or is this
pro?
```
A reasonable proxy for that data is to identify the states that have a legal
provision allowing minors to access routine health care without the consent of
their parents or guardian, at least under some circumstances.
```
ahhh so there are SOME circumstances already that prevent kids from getting
gender-affirming procedurs! I wonder if these circumstances will be expounded
upon, or treated as if they do not exist.

```
In states that have those provisions, puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones
should be more easily available to teenagers.
```
I'm assuming that this line is a typo and that the author does not believe this?
Or if the author does beleive this, then that's totally based.

```
The organization SchoolHouse Connection tracks state laws covering the ability
of minors to access medical care without their parents’ consent as part of its
advocacy on behalf of homeless children.
(16 “State Laws on Minor Consent for Routine Medical Care,” SchoolHouse Connection, September 3, 2021, https://schoolhouseconnection.org/state-laws​-on-minor-consent-for-routine-medical-care/ (accessed May 27, 2022).)

SchoolHouse Connection documents that 33 states and the District of Columbia
have some legal provisions that allow minors to obtain routine health care
without parental consent.
(17 Ibid.)

Seventeen states have no such provisions.
```
so the argument here is that homeless youth (who probably don't have parents
that care for them) should NOT recieve medical attention? That's unreasonably
messed up.

```
In states that do have such legal provisions, it is possible for adolescents to
obtain puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, at least under some circumstances,
as those medical interventions have come into broader use for youth who identify
as transgender.
(18 Ibid.)
```
this actually brings up a great point: Should homeless youth be banned from
gender-affirming procedueres in the same way that non-homeless youth are proposed
to be by the author? I disagree with this. I think that if the government is
going to refuse to take care of these children (which they absolutely should),
then said kids should have the ability to do whatever they want with their bodies,
since the world is now treating them like an adult. If the Right is truly pro-
self dominion, then they will agree with giving homeless children bodily
autonomy as well.

```
In states without such legal provisions, there is no regular process that allows
adolescents to obtain puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones without their
parents’ consent.

The conditions under which minors can access routine health care without parental
consent are extremely limited in some states. For example, in Arizona a minor
must be legally married, or documented as homeless, in order to access routine
health care without parental consent.
(19 “Arizona Revised Statutes Title 44. Trade and Commerce § 44–132. Capacity of Minor to Obtain Hospital, Medical and Surgical Care; Definition,” FindLaw, current as of March 8, 2022, https://codes.findlaw.com/az/title-44-trade-and-commerce/az-rev-st-sect-44-132.html (accessed May 26, 2022).)
```
I know this is an anterior issue, but Arizona really should amend this to allow
health care for all kids no matter what. There are many kids, who on paper have
parents who are repsonsible for them, when in reality, do not recieve the care
they should.

```
In other states, such as Minnesota, minors can obtain routine health care
without parental consent if they live separately from their parents, regardless
of the duration of that separation, and manage their own finances, regardless
of their source of income.
(20 “Minnesota Statutes Health (Ch. 144–159) § 144.341. Living Apart from Parents and Managing Financial Affairs,” FindLaw, current as of January 1, 2018, https://codes.findlaw.com/mn/health-ch-144-159/mn-st-sect-144-341.html (accessed May 26, 2022).)
```
as a result of a hatred of big government that many conservtives share, people
like disenfranchised children are the ones who suffer from a lack of social
programs. If social programs get cut like how many advocate for, who will take
care of those who fall through the holes from the very start of their lives?

```
In other states, such as Alabama, Louisiana, and Oregon, there only appears to
be a minimum age or a required determination by the health care provider that
the minor is mentally competent to obtain health care without parental consent.
(21 “Oregon Revised Statutes Domestic Relations § 109.640,” FindLaw, current as of January 1, 2019, https://codes.findlaw.com/or/title-11-domestic​-relations/or-rev-st-sect-109-640.html (accessed May 26, 2022); “Alabama Code Title 22.

```
If being trans is labeled to be a mental health disorder, then insurance companies
like in this instance will be able to discriminate against providing for these
kids, even if they choose to only socailly transition, but need important medical
care. This is a very dangerous situation that people who argue against trans
rights are prepetuating. For the cause of protecting the youth, anti-trans people
are inadvertantly hurting and perhaps killing said youth.

```
There is no obvious geographic, demographic, or partisan pattern to whether
states have these provisions. As seen in Appendix Table 1, states without a
provision are Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. The states with a provision
are similarly diverse and settled on their legal arrangements long ago for
reasons unrelated to the transgender issue.22
```
okay...

```
Prior Research
The effects of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones as a medical intervention
for adolescents who identify as transgender have never been subjected to a
large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT), like the kind that is
typically required for approval of new medications.
(23 Claudia Haupt et al., “Antiandrogen or Estradiol Treatment or Both During Hormone Therapy in Transitioning Transgender Women,” Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Vol. 11, No. 11 (November 2020), https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33251587/ (accessed May 26, 2022).)
```
here we go! RCTs are going to be also required to prove that gender-affirming
procedures increase suicide rates. Can't wait until I see the study from him that
says that.

```
Puberty blockers and sex hormones had been developed originally for other purposes.
Puberty blockers were originally designed to delay precocious puberty among very
young children who began puberty well before their peers. Sex hormones were
developed primarily to treat people who were unable to produce enough of the
hormones of their biological sex. These were the uses for which these drugs were
originally tested and approved. These drugs have been prescribed for young people
wishing to change their secondary sex characteristics without undergoing testing
and formal approval for these new uses. The lack of any experimental evidence of
the effects of these medical interventions prevents the gold-standard research
one would normally expect in order to isolate the causal effects of these
interventions. (24 Randomization in a randomized controlled trial isolates the exposure variable of interest and eliminates concerns of confounding in a statistical analysis.)
```
I totally agree that an RCT is needed in order to create as hard of proof as
possible for any scientific claim. However, the auther must know that having an
RCT in these circumstances (particulary a study that may or may not increase
suicide rates) is highly unethical. The best we can do is look at people's lives
after said people initiate gender-affirming procedures. That by itself has issues
of population bias though. All in all, there end up being way too many confounding
variables without RCTs. So if this is an admittance from the author on the
neccesity of RCTs in order to prove anything scientifically, then I expect the
author to follow through with that and extend the claim to the rest of this article
- including to all the positions held by the author himself in regards to the
dangers of gender-affirming procedures.

```
The use of puberty blockers and sex hormones to address gender issues is also
relatively recent, with widespread adoption occurring only within the past few
years. (25 Michael Biggs, “Puberty Blockers and Suicidality in Adolescents Suffering from Gender Dysphoria,” Archives of Sexual Behavior, Vol. 49, No. 7 (October 2020), pp. 2227–2229, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-020-01743-6 (accessed May 26, 2022), and Klotz, “The Fractious Evolution of Pediatric Transgender Medicine.”)

The fact that randomized experiments were not required for this use of puberty
blockers and sex hormones, and that this novel use of these drugs is relatively
recent, means that only a handful of studies examine their effects, and all
these studies use inferior correlational research designs.
```
1. according to some brief research, it looks like the specific hormone blockers
talked about (GnRH), were introduced in 1983, which means they have been around
for aprox 39 years. That's longer than aids medications have been around. That's
longer than many medications have been around. Using a sneaky temporal proximity
argument is another logical fallacy. Just because something is "relatively new",
or "relatively old", does not inheritly prove anything. The author though, is
attempting to insinuate that temporal proximity has somthing major to do in the
acceptance of medications, which is false.

2. since 1993, LUPRON DEPOT-PED has been aproved for human use.
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=020263

3. sure, these research designs may be inferior to RTCs, but many of these studies
are as good as we can get without breaking some serious ethics

4. Let's back up for a second: if we were to prove a correlation and causation
between a cetain activity and an increase in suicide due to said activity, how
would we do that? What biostatical instruments and/or methods can one use to
collect data on suicidality and injestibles? According to an article I found in
the National Library of Meicine, it maybe too unclear and/or unethical to create
instruments via biostatics to track rates of suicidality via anything aproximating
an RTC: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5517300/
"Most suicide risk assessment instruments were supported by too few studies to
allow for evaluation of accuracy. Among those that could be evaluated, none
fulfilled requirements for sufficient diagnostic accuracy." SO LET'S BACK UP HERE!
If suicide risk assessment in general is a percarious field of study without
enough research to go off of, then how can ANY item or activity be linked to
an increase in suicide risk with enough academic rigor desired by the author?
The answer is that there are no known ways of tracking suicide risk acuratly enough
to call it a science. At this point, tracking suicide risk is a guessing game.

```
The main defect of studies relying on correlational research designs is that
they are unable to determine with confidence whether any relationships between
receiving these drugs and later health outcomes are causal. That is, one can
never know with confidence whether the drugs cause those outcomes, or whether
other factors that make people more likely to receive the drugs were the causes.
This inherent weakness in correlational research is precisely why regulators,
such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, typically require randomized
experiments before approving a drug.
(26 U.S. Food and Drug Administration, “CFR– Code of Federal Regulations Title 21,” https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch​.cfm?fr=314.126 (accessed May 26, 2022).)
```

the keyword here is 'typically'. The FDA is no where near perfect. There are a
lot of things I believe they need to crack down on. Specifically suplements.
If something is a supplement, then it DOES NOT need to be tested by the FDA, which
is super messed up. However, the people who are generally anti-trans are on the
Right. Many people on the Right is anti government interference. If this track
follows, then there must be a consistency in this area. Either the individual is
pro-government interference in private sells of comodities, or the individual is
not. The individual cannot pick and choose what is and what is not allowed to be
investigated. Now I have no idea what the author's beliefs are on government
interference, but this must be stated in an effort to address the hipocracy
demonstrated by many on the Right.

I totally agree that we need more research. More research is absolutely the answer
here. I'm convinced that there are drugs that are magnitudes better than what we
have for blocking hormones. There always will be. However, if, because of the
lack of studies, legislators push to prevent studies taking place, then we will
never find the answers to these problems. Just because something is unknown does
not inheritly mean that said thing is dangerous. There are many subliminal
assumptions being made by the author too often that is affecting the reception
of the audience towards the subject at hand.

```
In an experiment, the only thing that determines whether people receive the
medical intervention is chance, so any differences in outcomes between those who
did and did not get the treatment would have to be caused by the intervention
and not another factor.
```
ahhh thank you Mr. Author. So, you're saying that perhaps other factors such as
bullying and societal hatred could be causes of suicide among trans children
more often than the gender-affirming procedures are? If there's even a chance of
this being true, then how much credence can we give to any pro or anti-trans
study? Are all the observational studies referenced thus far a net neutral for
the argument at hand?

```
This weakness of correlational research designs can be illustrated by examining
one of the most prominent studies claiming to find that adolescents who receive
cross-sex hormones have a lower risk of suicide.
(27 Jack L. Turban et al., “Access to Gender-Affirming Hormones During Adolescence and Mental Health Outcomes Among Transgender Adults,” PLOS ONE, Vol. 17, No. 1 (January 12, 2022), p. e0261039, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261039 (accessed May 26, 2022).)
```
again, the implication of this statement is that the inverse is true. The author
is using too much bias-charged language in this article. What this author is saying
is that no study on trans-sciences can be studied. However, the subtext is saying
even more than that, that being trans is scientifically wrong. The author continues
to make too many subliminal assumptions of the current science.

```
That study, led by Jack Turban of Stanford Medical School and published in
PLOS ONE in 2022, examines the results of a 2015 survey of more than 27,000
American adults who identify as transgender. The survey was not meant to be
representative of all such adults because its participants were recruited as a
convenience sample, largely through transgender support groups. Subjects were
asked whether they had ever sought cross-sex hormones, and then whether they
had ever received them. Respondents who never sought cross-sex hormones were
excluded from the analysis. The main comparison examined in the study was between
those who had sought and received the hormones, and those who had sought but
never received them when they were between 14 and 17.

The obvious defect in this comparison is that there are reasons why some people
were able to get the hormones while others could not, even though all of them
report wanting to get them. The reasons that allowed some to access them but not
others are likely strongly related to later mental health.
```
okay stop. How do you know that they were not allowed to get the hormones because
of mental health??????? This is flat out heresay. Where is the evidence? Even
if this is true, the author does not cite evidence directly. I should not have
comb through the study to verify if this true or is not. This statment must be
cited directly because of how large of a claim this is. And the use of 'probably'
when referencing a study? You want to talk about bad science? using the word
'probably' in a coloquiol way like so is just bad writing.
```
One of the most important reasons why some adolescents were able to access the
hormone therapies while others could not is that parental consent is often,
though not always, required to get these drugs. As is well known from research
on gender-confused youth...
```
again, the use of 'gender-confused' is highly subjective. The author needs to
define such terms. Classically, 'gender-confused' has been linked to not following
gender stereotypes within children (like boys playing with dolls). This behavior
is almost always grown out of. This behavior is NOT being trans. It's something
else entirely. A complete conflation of terms. Due to this conflation, the author
is either uneducated on these details, or the author is dishonest.

```
...as well as more generally, closer and more positive relationships between
children and parents promote mental well-being and is protective against suicide.

The problem, then, with the Turban study, is that it is impossible to know
whether the reduced odds of contemplating suicide among adults who sought and
received hormone therapy as children were a result of the relationship with
their parents who gave consent for this intervention or a result of the
intervention itself.
```
Yeah, I agree with that. It's impossible to really know. However, I disagree with
the subtext from the author and the tone he is taking. The author is subtexually
arguing that because the study cannot be supported by an RCT, that being trans
is either dangerous or wrong and that it's corrupting the youth.
```
If a close and positive relationship between parents and children struggling
with gender identity is the key to successful outcomes for those adolescents,
then the hormones themselves might make no difference, or even be harmful.
But that effect would be masked by the kind of parent–child relationship that
exists when parents are more likely to consent.
```
I pretty much agree with this, but again, the bad-faith subtext wrong.

```
Turban’s own data show enormous differences in relationships between children
and parents among those who obtained the hormones and those who did not,
despite desiring them. Of those who were unable to get the hormones, 35 percent
had not “come out” to their parents, compared to 3 percent among those who
obtained hormones at ages 14 and 15, and 4 percent among those who obtained
hormones at ages 16 and 17. Among those who got the hormones as teenagers,
nearly 80 percent reported feeling supported by their parents, compared to 33
percent of those who were unable to get the drugs.

Turban attempts to control statistically for these reported differences, but
that adjustment cannot fully fix the bias, especially when the differences between
the groups being compared are so stark and when the measures of parent–child
relationship are imprecise. This would be like trying to adjust for the effects
of family income during childhood knowing only whether someone reports having
felt poor. Memories are imperfect, and simply dividing people into poor and
not-poor categories fails to capture the difference between the children of
billionaires and those raised in public housing projects. Adolescents who can
get their parents’ consent for hormone therapy have dramatically different
relationships with their parents than those who cannot, and that difference
in relationship can affect mental health later in life, even if the hormones
themselves have no benefit, or are harmful.
```
Yeah I pretty much agree, though the money analogy was dumb.

```
Another important factor that determines whether young people get cross-sex
hormones is their psychological condition when they are seeking that intervention.
According to guidelines issued by WPATH, a key condition for prescribing
cross-sex hormones is that “any coexisting psychological, medical, or social
problems that could interfere with treatment (e.g., that may compromise
treatment adherence) have been addressed, such that the adolescent’s situation
and functioning are stable enough to start treatment.”
(28 Eli Coleman et al., “Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender-Nonconforming People, Version 7,” International Journal of Transgenderism, Vol. 13, No. 4 (2012), p. 19, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15532739.2011.700873 (accessed May 26, 2022).)

The difference between those who desired hormone therapy and received it and
those who sought it but were unable to receive it could be the state of their
mental health at the time they tried to get the drugs.
```
Again, this is heresay. The author is making the argument that trans youth are
mentally unstable which is extreamly biased to say, especially because this statemnet
is 100% conjecture. I would hope that the reader is able to understand the
saturated bias in this article, but perhaps the reader is still reading this due
to bias confirmation themselves.

```
The Turban study lacks information on, and therefore cannot make any statistical
adjustments for, the mental health at the time the subjects sought hormone therapy.
The respondents who were unable to get hormone therapy despite saying they wanted
it may have worse mental health outcomes because they began with more severe
psychological issues that prevented them from obtaining the hormones.
The pre-existing mental health challenges could be the cause of later outcomes,
not whether they received the hormones.
```
again, even more heresay.

```

The inability to sort out this kind of uncertainty about what is causing
differences in mental health outcomes is inherent in the correlational research
design employed by Turban and his colleagues. These same concerns apply to an
earlier study by Turban and his colleagues published in Pediatrics in 2020.
This study examines the relationship between puberty blockers and later mental
health outcomes and relies on the same correlational research design to analyze
data from the same survey as the cross-sex hormone study.
(29 Jack L. Turban et al., “Pubertal Suppression for Transgender Youth and Risk of Suicidal Ideation,” Pediatrics, Vol. 145, No. 2 (February 2020), p. e20191725, https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-1725 (accessed May 26, 2022).)

The use of a correlational research design also makes it impossible to draw
causal conclusions from a study by Amy Green and colleagues that analyzes the
mental health effects of adolescents receiving cross-sex hormones based on data
from a different survey.
(30 Amy E. Green et al., “Association of Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy with Depression, Thoughts of Suicide, and Attempted Suicide Among Transgender and Nonbinary Youth,” Journal of Adolescent Health, Vol. 70, No. 4 (April 2022), pp. 643–649, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.10​.036 (accessed May 26, 2022).)

```
I feel like the author is repeating himself at this point.

```
The two studies led by Turban, and the one led by Green, are the only three
studies that examine the relationship between cross-sex medical interventions
by teenagers and suicide risks that make any use of a comparison group. As the
2020 Turban study describes itself, “This is the first study in which
associations between access to pubertal suppression and suicidality are examined.”
(31 Turban et al., “Pubertal Suppression for Transgender Youth and Risk of Suicidal Ideation.”)

The 2022 Turban study observes that there have been six studies that track the
mental health outcomes of teens who received hormone treatments, but emphasizes
that “these studies did not include a comparison group of adolescents who did
not access GAH [gender affirming hormones].”
(32 Turban et al., “Access to Gender-Affirming Hormones During Adolescence and Mental Health Outcomes Among Transgender Adults.”)

Studies that track adolescents who receive these medical interventions are even
weaker than correlational studies in their ability to draw causal conclusions
about the effects of those interventions, because they have no information on
how those individuals would have fared had they not received the interventions.

The prior research on this subject is not only weak because it contains no
credibly causal studies and only a handful of correlational studies, but also
because those correlational studies are poorly executed. For example, the 2022
Turban study combines the use of testosterone for natal females and estrogen
for natal males and only reports the combined effects of hormones. When Michael
Biggs analyzes the same data and disaggregates the hormone by type, he finds
that: “Males who took estrogen are more likely to plan suicide, to attempt
suicide, and to require hospitalization for a suicide attempt.”
(33 Michael Biggs, “Comment on Turban et al. 2022: Estrogen Is Associated with Greater Suicidality Among Transgender Males, and Puberty Suppression Is Not Associated with Better Mental Health Outcomes for Either Sex,” figshare, journal contribution, 2022, https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare​.19018868.v1 (accessed May 27, 2022).)
```
this last statement is still conjecture. see the previous arguments I've made
above...

```
This negative effect is masked in Turban’s study by the failure to report the
separate effects by type of hormone.

Similarly, the 2022 Turban study finds that 16- and 17-year-olds who received
hormones were more than twice as likely to report a “past-year suicide attempt
requiring inpatient hospitalization,” but that finding fails to achieve
statistical significance by setting the standard for significance higher than is
conventional.
(34 Turban et al., “Access to Gender-Affirming Hormones During Adolescence and Mental Health Outcomes Among Transgender Adults.”)
```
Okay, so here's another dishonest take from our dear author here: If the author's
point is that this study is unreliable, then leave it at that. If the author is
then going to use the same study he fought to discredit by using it to prove a
point that he wants to be proven, then that's just crazy. I know that he is saying
that the data collection is wrong as a whole (which I don't disagree with),
but to then turn around and point at a line in the same study to prove a point
that the author wants proven- is just flat out silly and receives another mark
of dishonesty.

```
Only by adopting a standard for statistical significance that is different from
the one more commonly used in empirical research does the study avoid
concluding that this significant harm from hormone therapy exists.
```
and again we find more toxic subtext...
```
The two Turban studies do not consistently use the same set of control
variables when generating their adjusted-odds ratio, even changing what is
controlled when analyzing different outcomes within the same study. The two
Turban studies also change the main outcome of interest from lifetime suicidal
ideation in the study on puberty blockers to suicidal ideation in the last 12
months in the study on hormones. Researchers should determine which confounding
variables to control and which outcome variable to examine in their statistical
models based on sound theory and prior empirical research, and then consistently
apply those decisions, especially within the same study. Changing which factors
are controlled in the statistical analysis of each outcome variable, as well
as which outcome on which to focus, opens the door to p-hacking, the process
of changing empirical models in an ad hoc fashion to yield desired, though
likely spurious, results.

The bottom line is that the most influential recent research on the relationship
between adolescent cross-sex interventions and later mental health outcomes, 
including suicide risk, does not provide convincing evidence. Only a small
number of studies make comparisons to a control group—and those studies employ
correlational research designs that do not allow causal conclusions, nor have
those correlational studies been conducted properly.
```
thank you for reaching a bottom line. At this point, I think my point has been
made in reference to the author's commentary on this study.

```
A Better Research Approach
Of all the adolescents who seek medical interventions for gender issues, there
are reasons why some receive interventions while others do not. The defect of
correlational research designs is that they cannot separate the effects of
those reasons from the effects of the interventions themselves. A better
research design would be built around the reasons why some do and others do not
get the intervention, which have nothing to do with possible later outcomes.
The gold standard of research designs is the RCT because then only chance
determines whether some people get the treatment, not a factor that could be
related to later outcomes.
```
WAIT WHAT!??? My man is litterally arguing for an RCT to happen in order to test
suicide rist????? The author has clearly never once taken a second to think about
bioethics. Even I, a person who hasn't taken a biology class since 6 years ago,
knows that it is extreamly unethical to perform a test like this.

```
Short of using lotteries to determine who gets the intervention, there are
quasi-experiments or natural policy experiments, (35 A natural policy experiment
occurs when there is variation in policies across states or localities for
reasons that are unrelated to outcomes being compared. This “exogenous”
variation in state policies approximates a randomized experiment. While states
or localities do not adopt different policies by random assignment, the
variation is effectively random for the purposes of comparing the effects of
those policies on a particular outcome.) whereby the reason people, whether
adults or minors, can or cannot get the intervention is determined primarily by
policies that were adopted for reasons that have nothing to do with the later
outcomes of treated individuals. This circumstance approximates a randomized
experiment. By chance, some find themselves living under rules that allow them
to access treatment, while others find themselves under different rules that
do not allow them to do so.

There exists a natural policy experiment of this type with respect to the
ability of minors to access gender-related medical interventions without their
parents’ consent. As described above, some states have policies that provide a
path by which minors can access routine medical care without the consent of a
parent, while other states do not. These policies were developed for reasons
that have nothing to do with gender identity. Whether adolescents live in a
state that imposes fewer or no restrictions on accessing puberty blockers and
cross-sex hormones is effectively random and should have nothing to do with
later outcomes other than through the mechanism of receiving those interventions
or not.
```
The author essentially states here that if a law was passed many years ago that
has nothing to do with the issue at hand, then there will be no effect of that
law on an individual today. This is completely incoherit. If this is the belief
the author holds, then I can only assume that the author does not believe that
history affect the modern day. Of course if there is a law which prevents access
to medical care by indivduals is going to affect the individual who either can
or cannot recieve gender-affirming procedures. And if we take a look at that
history of states rejecting medical care to minors, we must also learn of the
reasons why. We must know why a basic human right is being prevented from being
extended to children. Is it because corporations sit in the pocket of those who
govern in these states? Is there a correlation between states who are
trans-friendly and those states who do extend medical care to minors? Is there a
correlation of the inverse? I don't know the answer to these questions, but these
are questions none the less, and where there are doubtful questions, there are
confounding variabls that must be accounted for. Waving ones hand and dismissing
the history of these laws is an extreamly silly thing to do, and I would hope that
the audience can see this clearly for what the author is doing here. Yet another
mark of dishonesty.

```
The analysis presented in this Backgrounder exploits this natural policy
experiment to compare suicide rates over time among those ages 12 to 23 in
states that have a provision allowing minors to access health care without
parental consent relative to states that have no such provision. Annual suicide
rates by age and state between 1999 and 2020 were obtained from the National
Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
(36 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “WISQARS—Web-Based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System,” December 2, 2021, https://www​.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html (accessed May 26, 2022). Note: “The data source for WISQARS Fatal Injury Data is the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) operated by the National Center for Health Statistics. WISQARS provides death counts and death rates for the United States and by state, county, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, sex, leading cause of death, injury intent, and injury mechanism categories. WISQARS can be used to query death data for the years 1999–2020, of which the underlying cause of death is specified using ICD-10 codes.” See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “WISQARS, Leading Causes of Death Visualization Tool,” https://wisqars.cdc.gov/DataRestriction_inj.html (accessed May 31, 2022).)

Information on whether states had policies allowing minors to access routine
health care without parental consent was obtained from SchoolHouse Connection,
an organization focused on caring for homeless youth.
(37 “State Laws on Minor Consent for Routine Medical Care,” SchoolHouse Connection.)
```
so when the author goes through the previous Turban study, he reiterates over and
over again that correlative observation studies are not reliable. The author then turns around and
says 'the better research approach' is to use a correlative observation study
inspecting suicide and parental care? Like what the heck? Is this guy high?
There is zero consistency here! HAHHAHAHA

```
The analysis presented here uses a statistical model to predict the suicide
rate among those ages 12 to 23 in each state between 1999 and 2020. The analysis
focuses on this age range because it encompasses a consistent age group of those
who could have entered puberty between 2010 and 2020 when puberty blockers and
cross-sex hormones became available as a gender-related treatment in the United
States. To control for the possibility that there are enduring cultural, religious,
or other state-specific features that account for why some states have higher
suicide rates among young people than other states, the model controls for
average suicide rates in this age group in each state at baseline (during the
first three years observed).

To control for the possibility that there are state-specific factors that
account for why some states may generally experience changes in annual suicide
rates, the model also controls for the suicide rate in each state in each year
among those ages 28 to 39. The Heritage model controls for the suicide rate
among that age group because it is a consistent age group in which no one would
have been a minor in 2010 when puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones became
available in the U.S. Because even the 28-year-olds in 2020 would have been 18
in 2010, none of them would be affected by variation in state policies
regulating the ability of minors to receive health care without parental consent
when these medical interventions began to be used.

The model also includes an indicator variable for each year between 1999 and
2020 to control for any year-specific national changes in suicide rates. And,
because there may be correlations between the suicide rates within each state
across the years examined, the model clusters the standard error estimates by
state.

The independent variable of interest is a dichotomous measure of whether the
state has a policy that allows minors to access health care without parental
consent. If making it easier for minors to access puberty blockers and cross-sex
hormones is protective against suicide, one should expect the frequency of youth
suicide to be lower in states that have a provision allowing minors to get
these drugs without parental consent after 2010. There should be no difference
in trends in the suicide rate among young people based on whether states have a
provision allowing minors to access health care without parental consent before
2010. If Turban and his colleagues are correct, the trends between these two
groups of states should diverge after 2010 as cross-sex interventions became
more widely available.
```
Okay, this study is just flat out stupid. By that logic, the states that have
historically the closest families despite trans populations, should be the states
that have the lowest rates of suicide-- but guess what? That's not how this works.
Utah is #9 out of all the states in highest suicide rates. Conversly, Utah is #46
in trans population. If having a strong family and community is the answer to
suicide, then Utah should not be as high as it is. Most of the population is LDS
and as you drive through the state, temples and meeting houses are a dime a dozen.

```
The trends are modeled statistically in a few ways. The most precise approach
is to examine whether the suicide rate among young people is elevated as those
interventions become more widely available in the states where it is easier for
minors to access them. The model uses the prevalence of gender-related medical
terms in Google Trends as a proxy for how widely available those interventions
are over time.
```
Okay, STOP! Google Trends is NOT RELIABLE! It's a black box. We don't know any
numbers behind Google Trends! This article has itself stated this. Any 'study'
that uses Google Trends is DISHONEST in the highest degreee.

```
Another approach would be to model the increased suicide rate in states where
minors can access health care without parental consent over time. This could be
done by including in the model an “interaction” variable that estimates the
effect of whether states have a provision for minors accessing health care
without parental consent each year separately. This variable would estimate the
difference in youth suicide rates between states based on whether they have such
a policy for each year between 1999 and 2020.

Yet another way to model the trend over time would be to estimate the combined
effect of whether states have a policy along with a time variable that counts
the number of years since 1999. This approach would identify any extant linear
trend across time that differs between the two groups of states. It would also
be possible to determine whether the two groups of states differ in their level
or trend in youth suicide rates before and after 2010, when puberty blockers
and cross-sex hormones become available.

The results remain substantively the same in their general magnitude, direction,
and statistical significance regardless of the approach.
```
okay so this is just flat out gobeldy-gook. He can't flip flop from hating on
observational studies and then say that the answer to the problem at hand is
an observational study. The author's position on what makes a study valid is

The Results
In the past several years, the suicide rate among those ages 12 to 23 has become
significantly higher in states that have a provision that allows minors to receive
routine health care without parental consent than in states without such a provision.
Before 2010, these two groups of states did not differ in their youth suicide rates.
Starting in 2010, when puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones became widely
available, elevated suicide rates in states where minors can more easily access
those medical interventions became observable.
```
the number of school shootings since 2010 has also dramatically gone up. My point
is that correlation does not equal causation as the old saying goes. Something
this author has completly forgotten in the last half of this article.

```
Rather than being protective against suicide, this pattern indicates that easier
access by minors to cross-sex medical interventions without parental consent is
associated with higher risk of suicide. The Heritage model plotted the difference
in a three-year rolling average of suicide rates between states with minor access
provisions and states with no such provision. Chart 2 plots the trend in this
difference for those ages 12 to 23 who could have been affected by the policy
when cross-sex medical interventions became available. For comparison, Chart 2
also shows the trend in this difference for a group ages 28 to 39, who could not
have been affected by these policies, since the people in this group would have
been at least 18 when puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones became available.
```
Again, puberty blockers have been available since 1983!!!!!!!!!! This guy
did not do his research!

```
Without making any adjustments, suicide rates among those ages 12 to 23 (blue
line) begin to spike in states that have provisions that allow minors to access
health care without parental consent relative to states that have no such provision
around 2016, after cross-sex medical interventions became more common. By 2020,
there are about 3.5 more suicides per 100,000 people ages 12 to 23 in states with
easier access than in states without an access provision. There is no similar
spike in suicide rates among those ages 28 to 39 (grey line) at that time.

It is also clear that the states with a provision always had somewhat higher
suicide rates than the states with no provision. To isolate the effect of this
provision on youth suicide rates, it is better to control statistically for the
youth suicide rate in each state at baseline as well as the suicide rate in each
state in each year among the older and unaffected age group.

Making these adjustments and plotting three-year rolling averages yields the trend
pictured in Chart 3. It is clear that the presence of a state-level provision
for minors to access health care without parental consent makes no difference in
suicide rates among those ages 12 to 23 until about 2010, when the suicide rate
begins to drift up in states with easier access. In 2015, the estimated increase
in suicide rates in states with easier access accelerates. By 2020, there are
about 1.6 more suicides per 100,000 people ages 12 to 23 in states that have a
policy allowing minors to access health care without parental consent than in
states without such a policy. The average state suicide rate in this age group
between 1999 and 2020 was 11.1, making an additional 1.6 suicides per 100,000
an increase of 14 percent in the suicide rate.

This increase in suicide rates in states where it is easier for minors to
access puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones increased at almost the same time,
and to the same degree, as those interventions became available. Using Google
Trends results for the terms associated with those medical interventions as a
proxy for their availability shows that increased suicide rates in states with
easier access almost perfectly track the prevalence of those terms. (Compare
Charts 1 and 3.)
```
this guy is so silly. How many people have researched puberty blockers because
their favorite anti-trans activitst did an expose on them? Not everyone who
googles 'puberty blockers' is trans. This guy is either stupid or a liar.

```
This elevated rate of youth suicide is statistically significant at conventional
levels, and robust to different approaches to modeling the trend over time.
(See Appendix Tables 2–5 for regression results.)
```
again, by the author's own account, obersvational studies are not permissible.

```
It is useful to conduct a “placebo test” to examine whether the elevated rate
of suicides among young people in states where it was easier for minors to access
cross-sex interventions also existed among slightly older people who could not
have been affected by minor access provisions. Using the same exact regression
model while replacing the suicide rate among those ages 12 to 23 with the rate
for those ages 28 to 39 in the same states as the dependent variable shows no
relationship between the ease of accessing cross-sex medical care and suicide
rates among those too old to have been affected by these state policies.
(See Appendix Table 6.) This placebo test strongly indicates that making it
easier for minors to access puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones when those
interventions became available is causally related to increased suicide rates,
because no similar increase was seen by those slightly older who would have been
unaffected.

Discussion
The results presented in this Backgrounder provide strong evidence for the claim
that suicides among young people have increased significantly since 2010 in states
that have a policy allowing minors to access routine health care without parental
consent. That increase in suicide rates accelerated around 2015. Prior to 2010,
whether a state had such a policy or not had no significant effect on the trend
in suicide rates among those ages 12 to 23. The timing of the increase in suicide
rates only among young people, only after puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones
are introduced and used widely, and only in states where minors could access
those medical interventions without parental consent raises serious concerns
about their effects on suicide risks.
```
"The results presented in this Backgrounder provide strong evidence for the claim
that suicides among young people have increased significantly since 2010 in states
that have a policy allowing minors to access routine health care without parental
consent." Okay so is that just a trend for youth who have access to health care
without parental consent, or is this trend for trans youth? This guy just flip
flopped his entire thesis!!!! What in the world!
```

The research presented here does not directly examine whether the individuals
who receive gender-related medical interventions are at a higher risk of suicide,
but it does directly examine the state policies that facilitate minors accessing
those interventions without parental consent and finds that those policies raise
suicide risks among young people.
```
wow, there were so many hoops just jumped through. What about all the suicides
resulting from murder suicides at school shootings? Maybe there's moreso a mental
health crisis and less of a trans crisis. But the author is too afraid to say that
because then he will loose conservative supporters. the grift is real.

```
To believe that easier access to puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones are
not the cause of elevated suicide risk in those states, one would have to be
able to imagine other medical interventions that only became widely available
after 2010 and would only affect young people. The lack of theoretically
plausible alternatives strengthens the case for concluding that cross-sex medical
interventions are the cause of the observed increase in suicide among young people.
```
Well, when you play with the data this much, you can get just about any conclusion
you want. for example, since 2008, (which is close to 2010), marvel movies have
released more and more frequently. I could just as easily draw up a graph showing
that marvel movie releases are the cause of the increase in trans-youth suicide
and my observation would be JUST AS TRUE as what has been presented in this article.
And again, the author spent the first half of the article tearing down as to why
observational studies are not trustworthy, just to go back and say the answer
to the problem at hand are more observational studies. Like give me a break.
To the unassuming reader, the author's praise of RCTs as a form of 'gold standard'
of studies, and then a perscription of how one can build a study to successfully
draw a conclusion from the data, leads the unassuming reader to believe that the
author has given a 'gold-standard' approach to solving this problem. What a liar.

```
State Policy Recommendations
At a minimum, the results presented in this Backgrounder demonstrate that efforts
to lower legal barriers for minors to receive cross-sex medical interventions
do not reduce suicide rates...
```
true
```
...and likely lead to higher rates among young people in states that adopt those
changes.
```
false, as far as we know. this is pure conjecture.
```
States that currently facilitate minors’ access to routine health care without
the consent of a parent or legal guardian should consider revising such policies.
States should also adopt parental bills of rights that affirm that parents have
primary responsibility for their children’s education and health, and that require
schools to receive permission from parents before administering health services to
students, including medication and gender-related counseling to students under age 18.
```
unfortuneatly, the author has utterly failed to prove that such would work. All
he has proved is that he loves Google Trends enough to marry and consumate with.

```
This research adds to the well-established wisdom that children are better off
if they are not allowed to make major life decisions without their parents’
involvement and permission.
```
THIS IS LITTERALLY A LOGICAL FALLACY! He's using a truism here!!!! This guy doesn't
know anything about anything when it comes to writing articles! He's just pandering
to his trans-hating audience here! hahahaha!!!!!!
```
In general, parents are better positioned than anyone else, including the
children themselves, to understand the needs of their children when making
important decisions.
```
thank you for pointing out yourself that you are using a generalization fallacy!
AND GUESS WHAT this is generalizing SO HARD RIGHT NOW, that all the youth kicked
out of their parents homes for being LGBT- who are now homeless- are NOT covered
by this AT ALL! This author does not, and never has lived in the real world. Sure
this *might* be true if we lived in a 1950's nuclear family american that also
**never** existed, but we obviously DO NOT! Too many parents straight up DO NOT
care about their kids, and to just magically expect so, is SILLY!

```
State policies that undermine this relationship between parents and children are
dangerous and should be repealed. Similarly, those who work with children in
professional capacities, including health, education, and counseling, should be
careful about substituting their own judgment for that of the parents. The
research presented here supports the view that children fare significantly better
when their parents have the authority to know about, and help to make, major
decisions for their own children.
```
*helicopter parrent alert* and none of these claims have been substantiated in
this article.
```

Lastly, given the danger of cross-sex treatments demonstrated in this Backgrounder,
states should tighten the criteria for receiving these interventions,
including raising the minimum eligibility age.
```
I also cannot believe I didn't catch this before, but the term 'cross-sex' is
super wrong, even in the context of this article. Sex is biological, while gender
is social. Any treatment done to a person's body does not change their sex, it
changes their social expression. A trans woman is still male. And NO ONE who actually
knows what they are talking about will argue otherwise.


All in all, this article #1 did not prove it's own thesis statement, #2 was deeply
inconsistent in perscriptions towards data collection and analysis, #3 completly
lazy (and one can only assume bigoted) in their mish-mash of academic terms,
colloquial terms, and made up terms, and #4 used politically charged language at
every corner (in the sneakiest ways possible) in order to make being trans appear
to be nothing more than a raw mental illness.
